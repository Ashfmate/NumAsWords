# Num As Words

Really simple to understand. I want to input a number, and get the words representation of the number.

So 1550 -> one thousand five hundred and fifty

# Requirements

- You must parse English numbers. Other languages are bonuses (More on them later)
- You must not use any external libraries, what you get from your language is what you use.
- If you would want to use a framework for viewing purposes (like react or flutter) then you can only use that, no plugins or packages more.
- The "and" between the hundreds and the tens/units is mandatory.
- You must put your language/framework of choice in a directory and call it {language/framework}_num_as_words.
	- If your language/framework of choice has different case standards, it is best to use theirs, otherwise default to snake case
- The program has to work on any number, even negative ones.
	- Minimum integers size is four bytes. So from negative 2 billion up to positive 2 billion is required, anything above is bonus (again more on that later)
- There must be a README file in the directory to tell me how to build it, and if there might be errors, how to fix them (I don't want to abuse ChatGPT with questions).

IDK, maybe I will another requirement but this is what I can get

# Contribution guide

Fork this repo, add your language/framework as stated in here [here](README.md#Requirements). Then submit your pull request and I will review it.

# Points

Points will be tallied for each of the participants in this manner.
- If the language of choice is a "low level" language, then it is given one point for the use of references and reasonably fast code (no need for ultra optimization).
- If the language of choice is a "high level" language, then it is given one point for being easy to read and maintain (again reasonably, no need for mega project level of design).
- If your language performs better than other participants in the field of your language's category (low level and high level like we discussed), then you get two points.
- If you language performs better than other participants in the opposite field of your language's category, then you get three points.
- Each feature you add (ones that are not from the requirements) counts as an extra point.

See if you have the skills to turn what we already do intuitively as humans and apply it in programming. I believe that is the best form of programming and it is one you would definitely learn much from.
